    <h1>History of marigold</h1>
    <p>Marigold, (genus Tagetes), genus of about 50 species of annual herbs of the aster family (Asteraceae), native to southwestern North America, tropical America, and South America. The name marigold also refers to the pot marigold (genus Calendula) and unrelated plants of several families.</p>

    <h2>Discription</h2>
   <p>Members of the genus Tagetes have attractive yellow, orange, or red composite flowers that are solitary on the stems or clustered. The leaves are arranged opposite each other on the stem and are usually finely cut. Characteristic bracts (leaflike structures) form a cup-shaped base below each flower head.</p>
    
    <h3>Species</h3>
    <p>One of the most common ornamentals is the Aztec, or Mexican, marigold (Tagetes erecta). Its dense heads of orange or yellow flowers are popularly planted in garden borders or as companion plants to deter pests in vegetable gardens. The Mexican marigold is also an important flower in DÃ­a de los Muertos observances in Mexico and other areas of Latin America. Another popular ornamental is the French marigold, which is usually listed as a variety of T. erecta or sometimes as its own species, T. patula. Several other species are grown as garden plants, and most have strong-scented leaves.</p>
