            <h2>Love At First Sight Story</h2>
            <p> Two teenagers badly fell in premature love the day they saw each other. They were classmates of the same co-educational school. They even shared the same desk & bench in the classroom and were in the VIIIth standard.
              They always stayed together in the morning prayer queue, school compound, classroom, etc. They used to exchange books and notebooks, solve homework, and even share their tiffins..</p>

            <h2>Neglect Love Life Story</h2>
            <p>I met a girl at the gym. At first, I adored her because she seemed so unreachable to me. She’s just gorgeous. She was a new member, and I supposed she noticed that I was looking at her.
            But then we went on separate classes, me to the yoga, and she to the rpm. The funny thing was that when I finished my class, there she was in front of me, she looked at me, and that was the first time I fell in love with her.
            Because of one thing to another, I waited for another meeting. I was thinking positively at the moment, “maybe she forgot me, or rarely online.</p>

            <h2> Romantic Sad Love Story</h2>
            <p>I thought you were the one. We were together for three years. We talked about marriage and even having kids together. We talked about what we would do if we ever lost each other, and we both gave a part of our pasts to one another.Ezoic
              I hate how our relationship ended, and it makes me so angry that you think I didn’t put in an effort or even care. I hate that after three years, you feel like I wanted nothing to do with you. It makes me mad to know that one argument, after being through so much, that that one small argument was the death of our relationship..</p>

            <p>The ray of light punishes me by waking me up too early. Oh, I try to turn, but I end up butting heads with someone else.“Auch,” the feminine voice yelp in pain. I know my head is made of stone. I can’t deny it, but who is this lady?
            I live alone, and I don’t have any girlfriend, yet I don’t remember bringing anyone home yesterday, but how did this lady know my password? I can’t understand all of this..</p>

Why is no one replying to me? ” But the answer was nothing, the trears become falling from my eyes and no one with me.
