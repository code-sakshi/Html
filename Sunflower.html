    <h1>History of the sunflower</h1>
    <p>The sunflower is native to North America and was first grown as a crop by indigenous tribes over 4,500 years ago.

        The early Americans also discovered that sunflower oil could be extracted and used for cooking. The sunflower's oils and pigments were used as sunscreen or as the basis for a purple dye for skin, hair, or textiles</p>

     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>The common sunflower is an annual herb with a rough, thick, hairy stem and can grow 8-12 feet tall.

        The leaves are 3-12 inches long and coarsely toothed with a rough texture arranged in spirals around the stem. This plant has deep roots formed by the central taproot and abundant secondary roots.
