    <div><p>Paragraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.</p>

        Paragraph writing has been a part of the writing process in every studentâ€™s life. Not only for any examination but also in our personal lives, we will need to write about different topics. Paragraph writing is a simple process, and yet it needs special attention as you have to be short, precise and to the point.
